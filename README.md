## This is just a basic template for testing a Ruby file with RSpec


Primarily, this is done for the purpose of quickly jumping into a coding kata. Ideally, the bare minimum is here, so you may need to move things around to suit your particular use case.

Make sure that you change the name of the *ruby_file.rb* and change the reference to it in the spec_helper

If you want to test more than one file and/or break up your tests, you can add more files to the *app* folder and more test files to the *spec* folder. Just make sure to include the new files in `spec_helper.rb`
